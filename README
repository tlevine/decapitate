* Draw bird head, bird body, ground-dweller head, ground-dweller body (four symbols)

Outline

* Left side is a longitude-latitude map of the Earth proportions.
* Each phrase is an incident (deduplicated) or an empty phrase of sorts.

* Then they fall into a bucket on the next phrase, populating a histogram along the bottom.
